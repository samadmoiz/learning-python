# How to decompose a task into purposful function (cohension)
# How your function should communicate (coupling)

# Coupling:
# use argumnet to input and return to output
# use global variable only when it necessary
# don't change mutable arguments unless the caller expects it
# Avoid changing variable in another module file directly (use accesor
# function)

# Cohension:
# Each function should have a single, unified purpose

# Size:
# Each function should be relativly small
